# AGENTS.md — submerge

Instructions for AI agents working on this project. Read by Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc. Nested `AGENTS.md` files inside packages override this one for their scope.

## What this project is

**submerge** — a self-hosted web app for managing VPN subscriptions (client role). It ingests node sources (subscription URLs, `vless://`, `happ://`, client deep-links), parses nodes, generates a config for the **mihomo** (Clash) engine and controls it over the REST API, shows nodes with real-time latency/traffic, lets you pick the active node, and exposes a local SOCKS/HTTP proxy.

Audience: **self-hosted product**, single-admin (optional password), deployed via docker compose.

## Repository status (important)

- **PoC (working):** `combine/` (Node + vanilla JS), `happ-decoder/` (Python), `mihomo/`, root `docker-compose.yml`. **Do not touch until Phase 6** — it's the behavioral reference.
- **v2 (in development):** `packages/` — rewrite onto a modern stack. Spec: [docs/specs/2026-06-29-submerge-v2-stack-design.md](docs/specs/2026-06-29-submerge-v2-stack-design.md). Plans: `docs/plans/`.

## Language

- **Documentation, code comments, and commit messages — English.**
- UI-facing strings are currently Russian; i18n is out of scope for now (don't mass-translate the UI).

## Stack (v2)

Node **24 LTS**, strict TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, Biome, Vitest/Playwright.
- **server**: tRPC v11 · Drizzle ORM + SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL) · Zod 4 · pino · session auth (@node-rs/argon2) · SSE hub.
- **web**: Vite · React 19 · shadcn/ui · Tailwind v4 · TanStack Query/Router · uPlot · lucide-react · sonner.
- **shared**: domain Zod schemas + inferred types (single contract).

All dependencies are latest major at install time, pinned via `pnpm-lock.yaml`. **No legacy at the start.**

## Structure (target, v2)

```
packages/shared/   # Zod schemas + types — the front↔back contract
packages/server/   # tRPC, Drizzle, SSE, clients/ (mihomo, happ-decoder), modules/ (sources,nodes,settings,auth)
packages/web/      # React SPA
docs/{specs,plans,adr,architecture.md}
```

A server module = thin `router.ts` (validation + call) + `service.ts` (logic + Drizzle directly). No repositories/DI.

## Commands (v2)

```bash
pnpm install                            # install
pnpm -F @submerge/server dev            # dev server
pnpm test                               # all tests (vitest)
pnpm typecheck                          # tsc -b --noEmit
pnpm lint                               # biome ci .
pnpm format                             # biome format --write .
pnpm -F @submerge/server db:generate    # generate migration from schema
```

Server runs `.ts` via `tsx` (Node 24 strip-types does not remap `.js`→`.ts` specifiers in nodenext mode). PoC: `docker compose up -d` (combine+mihomo+happ-decoder).

## Conventions

- **Strict TS** (+ `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`). ESM, `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- **Formatting/linting — Biome** (not ESLint/Prettier). Run before committing.
- **Validation:** Zod at boundaries. **Responses from external services (mihomo, happ-decoder) MUST be `.parse()`d** — that's the main failure point.
- **Boundaries:** all interaction with mihomo/happ-decoder goes only through `packages/server/src/clients/*` (timeouts, retries, Zod). Don't call them over HTTP directly from modules.
- **Naming:** camelCase (TS), kebab-case (files), snake_case for DB tables/columns (mapped in schema.ts).
- **Anti-overengineering:** for the scale "one admin, dozens of sources, hundreds of nodes" do NOT introduce Postgres, GraphQL, Nx/Turborepo, hexagonal/CQRS/DI, OpenTelemetry. See ADRs.

## Workflow

- **TDD**: failing test first, then minimal implementation. Cover parsing/ingest logic with unit tests.
- **Frequent atomic commits**, conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). End the body with:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **Pre-commit gates:** `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` — green.
- Before using libraries, check the current API via **Context7 MCP** (Zod 4, tRPC v11, Drizzle, React 19) — versions are latest, the API may have changed.

## Do not

- Don't touch the PoC (`combine/`, `happ-decoder/`, `mihomo/`, root compose) until Phase 6.
- Don't pin outdated versions "for compatibility" — use latest.
- Don't commit secrets/runtime: `mihomo/config.yaml` (nodes), `*/sources.json`, `hwid.txt`, `.env`, `data/*.db` — all in `.gitignore`.
- Don't overengineer (see ADR-0004).

## Domain facts (don't re-discover)

- **happ://crypt** is decoded by the official Happ binary (Qt) in the `happ-decoder` sidecar (Xvfb + mitmproxy intercepts the decoded sub-URL). Static reverse decoders (LeeeeT) go stale due to key rotation — see ADR-0001.
- **X-Hwid** is a per-source flag (off by default): device-bound providers return a stub without it. For https subscriptions combine sends it; for happ the mitmproxy injects it. See ADR-0002.
- Subscription formats: clash-yaml, base64-vless, v2ray/sing-box JSON. Client deep-links (incy/clash/sing-box/…) wrap a URL, extracted by `extractSubUrl`.
- mihomo is the tunneling engine (Go), controlled via the Clash REST API.
